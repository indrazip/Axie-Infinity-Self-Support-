I**mportant: No Axie Infinity employee or volunteer will ask you for your seed phrase. That's the secret 12 world password for your wallet. If you give it to someone, they will steal your assets.**

### **General Fixes**

1. Restart your browser and device.
2. Reinstall the Axie application.
3. Make sure your Ronin wallet is unlocked. Do this by clicking the Ronin wallet icon and entering your password.
4. Try logging in and out of MetaMask/Ronin wallet.
5. Check your internet speed here: [https://fast.com/](https://fast.com/) - if your internet speed is very bad you might experience disconnects in game. Please change your location to fix.
6. Make sure you you have an account setup here: [https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/sign-up](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/sign-up)
